## About
This song was originally recorded in 2012.
We have re-recorded it in 2022 and are using this old piece as a benchmark for future recording and mixing. 
It was originally recorded with our vocalist, and is therefore melodically simpler than our current instrumental songs.

* There are 1-2 bass tracks.
* The guitars are recorded as quad-track DI.
* and 16 drum mics.
* 2-3 additional tracks are used for clean guitars or ornamentation.

The final sound may completely change. 
However, our current preference for this rough mix has been created
