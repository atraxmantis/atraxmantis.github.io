## About
This song was originally recorded in 2012.
We have re-recorded it in 2022 and are using this old piece as a benchmark for future recording and mixing. 
It was originally recorded with our vocalist, and is therefore melodically simpler than our current instrumental songs.

* All guitar/bass are recorded as direct input (DI) Hi-Z.
* There are 1-2 bass track DI.
* The guitars are recorded as quad-track DI.
* There are 16 drum mics.
* 2-3 additional tracks are used for clean guitars or ornamentation.
* All raw files catalogued, available as exported from DAW with 0 sync point.
* Cubase session available if preferential.

While this final sound may change drastically, 
our current preference for this rough mix has been created as listed:
