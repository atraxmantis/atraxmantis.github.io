<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>This song was originally recorded in 2012.
We have re-recorded it in 2022 and are using this old piece as a benchmark for future recording and mixing. 
It was originally recorded with our vocalist, and is therefore melodically simpler than our current instrumental songs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All guitar/bass are recorded as direct input (DI) Hi-Z.</li>
  <li>There are 1-2 bass track DI.</li>
  <li>The guitars are recorded as quad-track DI.</li>
  <li>There are 16 drum mics.</li>
  <li>2-3 additional tracks are used for clean guitars or ornamentation.</li>
  <li>All raw files catalogued, available as exported from DAW with 0 sync point.</li>
  <li>Cubase session available if preferential.</li>
</ul>

<p>While this final sound may change drastically, 
our current preference for this rough mix has been created as listed:
