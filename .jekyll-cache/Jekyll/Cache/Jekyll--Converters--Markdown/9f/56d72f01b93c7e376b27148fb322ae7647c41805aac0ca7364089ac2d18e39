<h2 id="band-history">Band history</h2>
<p>ATRAX MANTIS are a three-piece technical brutal death metal band originally from Kilkenny, Ireland.
The band was formed in the early 2000s by James Quinn (drums), Darran Guilfoyle (bass), and Dylan Lawless (guitar).
By 2004, James Meany (vocals) had joined.
In 2005, the band recruited a second guitarist named Eoin Brett but he left after a few months.
In 2006, James Meany was replaced by Tomás ‘T’ McMorrow on vocals.
Ferdia Bridgeman (guitars) joined to form the five-piece which were most recognisable as ATRAX MANTIS.
During this time, the band have shared the stage with many legends including CANNIBAL CORPSE, DESECRATION, FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE, SANATORIUM, CEPHALIC CARNAGE and MISERY INDEX.</p>

<p>In 2007 ATRAX MANTIS won the Kilkenny Battle of the Bands which rewarded them with studio time and was used to record their <a href="https://irish-metal.bandcamp.com/album/atrax-mantis-the-devoured-demos-2007">debut EP</a>.
The band have played all over Ireland and played dates in Holland with fellow Kilkenny band SLAVE ZERO.
2008 saw the release of their long awaited <a href="https://irish-metal.bandcamp.com/album/atrax-mantis-condemned-to-hatred-2008">EP entitled “Condemned to Hatred”</a>.
It was greeted with critical acclaim by many Metal fanzines.</p>

<p>Several live performances saw David (Dave) Byrne (bass) filling in for Darran during his hietis.
Dave contributed greatly to the band during this period as a full-time member, practising and writing with the gang.</p>

<p>ATRAX MANTIS had penciled in a new release for 2013 on their Myspace page and despite touring throughout that year nothing materialised. 
Despite splitting up the band were still referenced in the Irish Metal Scene as one of the most brutally heavy acts to play live!
With little funding, the band were unable to produce adequate recordings that they were happy to release from 2007-2013.</p>

<p>The whole lineup split ways after 2013 with several members moving abroad for work and university studies.
Everyone has remained good friends since 2013 but have been unable to get together for any full-time work.</p>

<p>In 2022 the founding members, James Quinn, Darran, and Dylan reformed the group.
With several years learning techniques for professional recording, engineering, and remote-working, the group has been able to begin writing and recording new material.
The first step was a benchmarking exercise, performed by re-recording “Ties that bind” in 2022 as a quality comparison to the version made in 2012.
With everyone happy in the technical and aesthetic quality, the band steamed ahead with their new material.</p>
