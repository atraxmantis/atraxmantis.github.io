We are tackling this problem of protein pathway analysis from the viewpoint of 
rare immune disease and infection.
Historically, several topics in bioinformatic and functional analysis have 
been required before we could achieve our current position of 
statistically-robust genetic discovery for rare disease:

1. Candidate variant select for individual genomes
2. Compiling reliable cohorts of patients with shared phenotypes
3. Protein-protein interactions
4. Variant collapse
5. Protein pathway analysis
6. Functional validation
